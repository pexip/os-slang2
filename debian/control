Description: S-Lang programming library, development version
 S-Lang is a C programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
 development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.
 .
 The S-Lang library includes the following:
  * Low level tty input routines for reading single characters at a time.
  * Keymap routines for defining keys and manipulating multiple keymaps.
  * A high-level key processing interface (SLkp) for
    handling function and arrow keys.
  * High level screen management routines for manipulating both
    monochrome and color terminals. These routines are very
    efficient. (SLsmg)
  * Low level terminal-independent routines for manipulating the display
    of a terminal. (SLtt)
  * Routines for reading single line input with line editing and recall
    capabilities. (SLrline)
  * Searching functions: both ordinary searches and regular expression
    searches. (SLsearch)
  * An embedded stack-based language interpreter with a C-like syntax.

Description: S-Lang programming library - runtime version
 S-Lang is a C programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
 development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.
 .
 This package contains only the shared library libslang.so.* and copyright
 information. It is only necessary for programs that use this library (such
 as jed and slrn). If you plan on doing development with S-Lang, you will
 need the companion -dev package as well.

Description: S-Lang programming library, shared library subset kit
 This is used to develop subsets of the S-Lang shared libraries for use
 on custom installation floppies and in embedded systems. Unless you're
 making one of those, you won't need this package.

Description: S-Lang library for Debian Installer
 This is a udeb, or a microdeb, of the S-Lang library with wide charater
 support. As such it is the installer counterpart of libslang2.
 You only need this package to support applications needing S-Lang during
 the Debian installation process time and probably don't need to select it.
